# 🎫Support Ticket Classification using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning system that automatically classifies customer support tickets based on their textual content.  
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system helps support teams reduce manual effort, improve response time, and manage tickets more efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
• Understand and work with real-world text-based support ticket data  
• Clean and preprocess raw textual information  
• Convert unstructured text into numerical features  
• Train a machine learning classification model  
• Evaluate the model using appropriate performance metrics  

## 🔍 What This Project Does
✓ Loads and explores customer support ticket data  
✓ Performs text preprocessing and cleaning  
✓ Applies TF-IDF Vectorization to transform text data  
✓ Trains a Logistic Regression classifier  
✓ Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
➤ Python  
➤ Pandas  
➤ Scikit-learn  
➤ Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
➤ TF-IDF Vectorizer  
➤ Logistic Regression  

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The performance of the classification model is measured using:
✔ Accuracy  
✔ Precision  
✔ Recall  
✔ F1-score  

These metrics help in understanding how well the model categorizes support tickets into their respective classes.

## 🎯 Outcome & Impact
This automated support ticket classification system:
✨ Minimizes manual workload for support teams  
✨ Speeds up issue resolution  
✨ Improves customer satisfaction  
✨ Enhances overall support operations
